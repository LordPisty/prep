### security principles

* **easiest penetration** an attacker will preferentially target easier exploits rather than harder ones (context dependent)
* **adequate protection** protect information commensurate with its value, keep in mind not only the primary value of the information or system but also how that information or system could be used
* **timeliness** protections allocated to that information or those systems should change
* **effectiveness** security controls need to be configured correctly
* **weakest link** a system is only as secure as its weakest link
